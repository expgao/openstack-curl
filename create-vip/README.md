# Create a port with specified IP address

Example

```bash
openstack port create --network net1 --fixed-ip subnet=subnet1,ip-address=192.0.2.40 port1
```

In the previous command, `net1` is the network name, which is a positional argument. `--fixed-ip subnet=<subnet>,ip-address=192.0.2.40` is an option which specifies the portâ€™s fixed IP address we wanted.
